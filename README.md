# Machine Learning From Scratch

This repo is intended to give you a good understanding of the basics of Machine Learning
from scratch (no dependencies except numpy). There are many amazing libraries out 
there like TensorFlow, pytorch, and scikitlearn - just to name a few - that use GPU optimization, 
implement the latest algorithms, and are written in C to deliver the greatest performance. 
The only problem with these libraries is that they abstract the HELL out of everything. This is great 
if you're a professional who just needs to deliver production code that is reliable, fast, and scalable, 
but if you're just starting out with Machine Learning it can make the "hands on" approach a lot less... 
well... "hands on".

I found that during my journey through Machine Learning I kept asking myself, "but how does this work??",
and although I read through many repo's and ML libraries to try and understand, everything seemed
so obscure. I hope to collect just the raw essence of ML here.

## Getting Started

While we are not going to use dependencies outside of Numpy, I recommend making a virtual environment
just to practice.

### Prerequisites

1) Python 3.X
2) A virtual environment
3) Numpy
4) Watch this video series: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk

For Windows
```
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
pip install numpy
```

For MacOS
```
python -m venv venv
. venv/bin/activate
pip install numpy
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
